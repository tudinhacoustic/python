# In the previous chapter we learned how to create a completely random array, of a given
# size, and between two given values.

# In this chapter we will learn how to create an array where the values are concentrated
# around a given value.

# In probability theory this kind of data distribution is known as the normal data distribution
# or the Gaussian data distribution, after the mathenmatician Carl Friedrich Gauss
# who came up with the formula of this data distribution.
