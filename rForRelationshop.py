# It is important to show how the relationship between the values of the x-axis
# and the values of the y-axis is, if there are no relationship the linear regression
# can not be used to predict anything.

# This relationship - the coefficient of correlation - is called r

# The r value ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 means no relationship, and 1 (and -1) means 100% related.

# Python and the Scipy module will compute this value for you, all you have to do is feed it with the x and y values.
